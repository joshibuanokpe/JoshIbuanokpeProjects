This is a personal project in Python that I believe may take a few months. It is still quite rough, it utilises OOP and a basic Tkinter GUI to add food items 
to an inventory. The eventual aims are:

- To create a mechanism that allows for food to be discharged
- To write and overwrite these data onto CSV (will be straightforward)
- To write the data using a relational database to develop SQL skills
- To be able to use datetime to incoroporate expiry dates, food order lead times
- To use this information to inform the most efficient combinations of food pack to give to households they serve, while minimising waste and finally
- Be able to provide prompts on what foods need tp be donated or ordered so that these actions can be taken before it is too late

I hope that as I learn more, these features that I want to add will become possible and I will hopefully be able to deploy the system at Southwark Foodbank,
the local Pecan that I have been a partner of for 2 years.
