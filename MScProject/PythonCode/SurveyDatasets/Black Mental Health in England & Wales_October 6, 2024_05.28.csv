Project Researcher:
Researcher Name:             Joshua Ibuanokpe

Researcher email:              jei501@york.ac.uk

What is the purpose of the project?
This project is being conducted by Joshua Ibuanokpe (jei501@york.ac.uk) and Farid Bello (farid.bello@york.ac.uk).

The aim of this project is to learn about Black mental health in England & Wales and evaluate the applications of machine learning algorithms to quantitative and qualitative data analysis.

Your participation in this project is voluntary. 

Why have I been chosen?
To take part you must be an adult aged over 18 who identifies as having Black or Mixed Black heritage, living in England & Wales. The aim is to survey 50+ participants in this study.

Do I have to take part?
No, participation is optional. If you do decide to take part, you will be given a copy of this information sheet for your records and will be asked to complete a participant consent form. If you change your mind at any point during the research activity, you will be able to withdraw your participation without having to provide a reason. To withdraw your participation you need to contact either Joshua Ibuanokpe or Farid Bello within one week (see contact details above) and request that your data be withdrawn, and this will be actioned as soon as possible.  

 
How will you use my data?
We will collect survey responses which will include basic gender, age and racial identity questions, followed by a series of questions asking for your perception of Black mental health in England & Wales.

The data collected from you will be anonymised, analysed and used to produce reports. Anonymised data may be reused by the research team or other third parties for secondary research purposes.  

What will I be asked to do?

The aim is to learn more about Black mental health. We expect that participating in the survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes. 

How will you keep my data secure?
Information will be treated confidentially and shared on a need-to-know basis only. We are committed to the principle of data protection by design and default and will collect the minimum amount of data necessary for the project. In addition, we will anonymise or pseudonymise data wherever possible.

",Positive,"This is mainly supplied through conversations with Black networks at work, childhood friends and family, which have all played a crucial role in establishing some relatability in experiences encountered as well as a feeling of unity. ",Positive,"I think there is a strong need to improve mental health in the Black community as the Black experience is unique with many Black people feel misunderstood and mistreated with very few people they can trust to open up to fully. ",Positive,"I believe the level and presence of mental health services dedicated to the Black community is insufficient or poorly visible, particularly given the trauma and suffering widely experienced in the black community at school, work or other walks of life.

",Negative,"I believe that the presence and level of anxiety in the Black community is only increasing, especially in light of recent racially-aggravated disturbances in the U.K. ",Negative,"The Black struggle is encountered by all Black people, of all ages and genders, simply for differences in the way Black people look, talk, etc. Being Black comes with people being presumptive about you and your nature, an almost daily struggle for some. Feelings of marginalisation and detachment, as mentioned above, are two of a multitude of emotions that highlight the Black struggle.",Strongly Negative,"Prevalent due to the emphasis placed on material wealth by many Black role models in popular culture, which is becoming increasingly visible particularly online.",Positive,"Strong as many Black people rely on the church to provide their sense of Ccommunity. ",Strongly Positive,"I feel there is a significant level of hate in Black community in light of recent political and social history in the West. More and more in recent years, Black people are also not accepting the mistreatment or racism/micro-aggressions we continue to experience, and are growing more vocal and passionate in their disprovals which, in turn, is likely bringing Black people closer together. However, I believe self-hate is still prevalent within the Black community. Outside of family and workplace mentors, Black role models are often limited to popular culture where they are frequently depicted as materialistic. This leads to members of the Black community feeling a sense of inadequacy and self loathing when comparing lifestyles and material possessions. ",Negative,"In an increasingly digitised, pressurised, and arguably divided world, increased access for improving one's mental health through a digital medium would be a very useful tool for the Black Community. ",Positive,"I think this is a fantastic idea as this would empower many Black people to express their true emotions, positive and negative with other Black people. In bringing us together, this would also promote a sense of self worth and love, eventually spreading to others, central to improving mental health within the Black community.",Strongly Positive
