  This was a University project in Python where we were given the Bank churn scenario from Kaggle. I was tasked with assuming the role of an analyst aiming to give insights on which indicators lead to customer churn. Furthermore, it was also investigated if fraudulent accounts can be determined through activity, but only by using one other attribute.

  This was a challenging task, but very enjoyable as it was my first experience using Random Forest models. The report is included in this directory.
